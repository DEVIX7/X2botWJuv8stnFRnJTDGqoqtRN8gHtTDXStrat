## Why did you make TDX Strat?

In late May - start June 2024, I realized that the existing automation tools weren’t meeting my needs for functionality. That’s when I thought: why not create my own solution with “masterpiece” code for me and my friends?

(A half month later --->) I saw that the project could be improved, so I began developing my own modules for easier and more efficient function calls. What started as a personal experiment soon showed potential for a wider audience after I stabilized the project.

A few days later, I publicly announced TDX Strat.
I was inspired by tools like AutoStrat by MoneyMaker and [Strategies X](https://github.com/Sigmanic/Strategies-X) by Sigmanic and Gurty.
